            <div class="blog-html">
              <p>This week we will utilising the use of elastic bands to help increase hip strength and mobilisation so please
                ensure that you bring a range of bands to training. If you don't have any bands yet I have some spares that
                you can utilise but please go online tonight and purchase a black, red and purple band, these normally cost
                between £1.50 - £3 each.</p>
              <p>
                To help you prepare for this activity please refer to the attached link and video for some of the exercises we will be using.
                Please have a look and try to understand how the band focuses on the key areas I have highlighted earlier
                - there will be a test so be prepared!!</p>
